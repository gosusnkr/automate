An automation tool that downloads CHAOS project discovery data every hour compares it with the master domain list, identifies new domains, runs Nuclei on it and automatically provides you with the final result via [notify](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/notify) and publish it to a variety of supported platforms like Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc. Cron job automation is already implemented. <br/>

    2. Set the integer value within the cron.sh file. It is a number of hours you want to automate this script in the background. Currently set to 3600 seconds means an hour. (SCREEN).    
    
    3. Set up and edit Notify Provider Config (default provider config file can be created at $HOME/.config/notify/provider-config.yaml) to suit your needs (support single / multiple providers where do you want to send the notification to)
    4. Open nerdbug.sh and set the provider in which is currently set as notify -provider <<provider to send the notification to (eg. telegram,discord,slack)>>
